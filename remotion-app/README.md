This package contains the Remotion project that renders the final video. Point it at a prepared `plan.json` and `input.mp4` (typically generated by the Python toolkit) and you can preview or render the composition in just a few commands.

## Commands

### Install dependencies
```console
npm install
```

### Start the interactive preview
```console
npm run dev
```
Launches Remotion Studio so you can scrub through the composition, tweak props, and validate timing.

### Render a video
```console
npm run render
```
Produces the final output in `out/` using the default composition. Pass custom props (for example, a different plan path or min-pause override) with the `--props` flag:

```console
npm run render -- --props '{"planPath":"public/input/plan.json","config":{"minPauseMs":800}}'
```

The render/build commands rely on the locally installed Remotion CLI, so make sure `npm install` has been executed first.

### Upgrade Remotion
```console
npx remotion upgrade
```
Fetches the latest compatible Remotion version.

## Runtime configuration

- `src/config.ts` centralizes the audio and transition defaults exposed to the renderer. You can override these values at render time by passing a `config` object through `--props` (see the render example above).
- Transition logic only fires when `silenceAfter` is `true` on a segment, so upstream planners should compute accurate silence windows.
- The Remotion layer consumes the extended highlight set (`typewriter`, `noteBox`, `sectionTitle`, and `icon`) and will gracefully no-op unknown types.
- B-roll placeholders (`segment.kind === "broll"`) render via `BrollPlaceholder` and can be swapped with real footage later without changing the plan contract.
