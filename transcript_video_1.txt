Transcript for [How I Would Learn Digital Marketing (If I Could Start Over)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8wJBq6vOAI) by [Merlin AI](https://merlin.foyer.work/)

0:00 - 14 years ago, I started my
career in digital marketing.
0:02 - And throughout that time, I've built and sold
a handful of online businesses, consulted
0:06 - for small shops to celebrities to the Fortune
500, and I've been recognized in business
0:11 - magazines like Forbes and Inc as an "SEO expert."
0:14 - To top it off, the United States government
considers me to be in the top 1% of my field.
0:19 - Now, despite any success I've had in digital
marketing, I've also made a ton of mistakes
0:24 - along the way that cost me
valuable time and money.
0:27 - So today, I'm going to show you how I would
learn digital marketing if I could start over
0:32 - and I'll also share some of my
biggest failures along the way.
0:35 - Alright, so the very first thing I'd do is to choose
just one area of digital marketing to focus on.
0:41 - And this is the opposite of what I did.
0:43 - So for context, in 2009, I started my first website
and I basically spammed forums and classifieds.
0:49 - That eventually slowed down,
so I tried paid advertising.
0:52 - And well… I wasted my money because
I had no idea what I was doing.
0:55 - But then social media was blowing up so
I pivoted to that and tried to go viral with
1:00 - coupon codes.
1:00 - Boy was that embarrassing!
1:02 - But still, I was making like a solid
$2,000 a month.
1:06 - I was officially a business man.
1:08 - So I decided to hire a search engine optimization
company because this is what we do!
1:14 - And that was the turning point for me
when my fire for SEO was ignited.
1:18 - They scammed me for everything I had.
1:20 - The good thing that came out of that though
was that it fueled me with rage so much so
1:25 - that I committed to focus on learning just
SEO and to get really good at it so I wouldn't
1:31 - have to hire another company.
1:32 - And by around 2011, my company was worth over
7 figures and the main reason is because of SEO.
1:39 - Now, by definition, digital marketing is just
marketing that happens over the internet.
1:43 - So you can choose to focus on just email marketing,
pay-per-click advertising, search engine optimization,
1:49 - social media marketing, etc.
1:51 - Digital marketing is just so vast that it's
impossible to become a master of all areas.
1:57 - It's best to focus on just one area of internet
marketing and to get really good at it.
2:02 - Now, after you've chosen the area of digital
marketing you want to focus on, you need to
2:06 - make a mental commitment
to learn as much as possible.
2:10 - Now, while there isn't a single "right" way
to learn digital marketing, what I've found
2:15 - to be helpful is to learn in 3 stages.
2:17 - So, for illustration purposes, let's say
you chose SEO as your focus area.
2:22 - Now, stage one is to focus on
understanding the fundamentals.
2:25 - So in SEO, that would include things like why
and how SEO is important for businesses,
2:31 - how search engines work, and the main ways
SEO is done – so that includes keyword research,
2:37 - link building, technical SEO and
on-page SEO to name a few.
2:41 - Fundamentals may not be exciting, but they're
absolutely critical to learning, whether you're
2:46 - learning an instrument, a new
recipe, or digital marketing skills.
2:51 - Stage two is all about making connections
in how the fundamentals work together.
2:55 - For example, you should be able to make
the connection in SEO that content creation
3:00 - is reliant on keyword research and that on-page
SEO is connected with both your content writing
3:06 - and keyword research.
3:08 - Finally, stage three is all about learning how
these techniques are executed – more specifically,
3:14 - you'll want to get an idea of workflows
and tools that you'll need to do your job.
3:19 - For example, you should at least know that
keyword research is done with a tool like
3:22 - Keywords Explorer.
3:24 - And the way people find keyword ideas is by
starting with a broad seed, going to a keyword
3:29 - ideas report, narrowing in on keywords with
a set of filters, and then analyzing the search
3:35 - engine results pages to understand
if it's possible to compete.
3:39 - These three stages are typically
how courses are taught.
3:42 - And for that reason, I think it's worth taking
a reputable beginner's course on the area
3:47 - of digital marketing you've chosen –
like our free SEO fundamentals course.
3:51 - This is something that I was too young and
arrogant to do when I was getting started
3:55 - with online marketing.
3:57 - I went with the unguided route and literally…
anytime someone said "advanced", I was like
4:02 - Pavlov's dog and I'd give them all my attention.
4:05 - I wasted tons of time and money because for
some reason, I subconsciously thought it would
4:10 - be more rewarding to figure it out on my own.
4:12 - Now, as you go through this learning stage
and consume content, there's going to be 
4:16 - a time when you feel like, "yeah,
this all makes sense!"
4:20 - But I can guarantee you that when you
actually get to doing it, it's not going to
4:24 - feel so straightforward anymore.
4:26 - And that's why the next thing I recommend is to
commit to actually practicing what you've learned.
4:32 - In my opinion, there's no better way to learn
digital marketing than to get first-hand experience.
4:37 - And the best way to do that
is to create your own site.
4:40 - This way, you'll have a safe place to
practice whatever and however you want.
4:45 - Now, as you commit to actually doing
something, I highly recommend doing two things.
4:49 - #1. Cut yourself off from all new content.
4:54 - You should have already consumed enough
through a course or whatever resources that
4:58 - you used to have a high-level view of what it looks
like to execute on the marketing area you've chosen.
5:04 - By cutting out new content, you'll be able
to stay laser-focused on actually practicing
5:09 - the fundamentals that will be an
essential building block to your career.
5:14 - And #2 don't obsess over things that
aren't moving your progress forward.
5:18 - For example, if you decide to build a hobby
site so you can practice SEO, don't spend
5:23 - hours trying to fine-tune your logo,
fonts or blog layout.
5:28 - As an SEO, you're going to want to focus on
driving organic traffic through high rankings
5:33 - in Google.
5:34 - Now, if you're able to actually put all these
things into practice, you will learn very quickly
5:39 - how to actually get results with SEO or social
media or email marketing or whatever area you
5:45 - chose to focus on.
5:46 - Now, if you want to know the fastest way to
accelerate your growth and to put this "doing"
5:51 - stage into overdrive, then I recommend
getting a job or internship at an agency.
5:57 - When you work at an agency, you get the unique
experience of being able to work on a diverse
6:02 - group of projects.
6:03 - Not only is the exposure great, but it forces
you to stretch that creativity muscle and to
6:08 - apply your learning in various scenarios.
6:11 - Now, perhaps the biggest advantage to working
at an agency is that you get to be in the trenches
6:16 - with people who are ahead of you
in their digital marketing career.
6:20 - You can ask them questions, watch them solve
problems, and in some cases, people may be
6:25 - willing to mentor you.
6:27 - Thriving agencies are usually fast-paced
environments, which obviously make them
6:31 - a great place to learn digital
marketing fast if that's your goal.
6:35 - Now, while you obviously want to learn
new skills as fast as possible, don't make
6:39 - the mistake of taking
shortcuts to get there.
6:42 - And I'm talking from experience here.
6:44 - Early in my career, I took an SEO
shortcut that cost me seven-figures.
6:48 - So my first company was an ecommerce store and
I was driving the majority of its traffic through SEO.
6:53 - Now, one of the hardest, but most important
parts of SEO is getting backlinks to your pages.
6:59 - And back in 2010 and 2011, backlinks were
pretty much all you needed to rank a page
7:04 - high in Google.
7:05 - So I came across a private blog network called
Build My Rank where I could buy virtually
7:10 - an infinite number of backlinks.
7:12 - And without fail, throwing a handful of links at
each product page would boost it to the top of
7:18 - Google for queries that were converting into
tens of thousands of dollars every month.
7:23 - The thing is, buying backlinks was and still
is against Google's webmaster guidelines.
7:29 - Now, while I was making a healthy
living, I was getting ready to cash out.
7:32 - But without warning, I lost like 85%
of my traffic and a ton of revenue.
7:38 - So when I sold the site a few months later,
instead of getting a low seven-figure buyout,
7:43 - I ended up getting, much, much,
much, much less.
7:46 - Now, had I focused on learning link building
so I can build backlinks whenever I want,
7:51 - not only would I have had a much nicer exit,
but I would have been able to apply those
7:56 - skills to pretty much every other
SEO-driven business I created.
8:00 - Bottomline: avoid shortcuts
because they can be costly.
8:04 - And you'll only really realize that in hindsight.
8:06 - Now, another thing I would do differently
is to actually build relationships with people.
8:10 - So, for like the first 8 years of doing SEO,
I literally didn't talk to anyone about what
8:16 - I did because most people just didn't understand.
8:19 - And it was lonely and I was really just
stunting my professional growth.
8:23 - So what I would do differently if I could start
over is try and network with two different
8:28 - groups of people.
8:29 - So, Group 1 would be like-minded people who
are trying to learn the same area of digital
8:34 - marketing as you.
8:36 - They're basically a safe place where you can
share your ideas, experiences, and insights
8:41 - without fear of judgment.
8:42 - And not only can you learn from each other,
but you'll also find motivation from each
8:47 - other to get better at your craft.
8:49 - In fact, this is what Mr. Beast did with a group of
friends in his early stages of his YouTube career.
8:54 - And in interviews, he frequently attributes
his success to having this group of people
8:59 - to grow with.
9:00 - And the second group of people I'd network
with are people you respect in your niche.
9:05 - All it really takes is an email or a DM saying,
"Hey, just wanted to let you know that I really
9:10 - admire your work.
9:11 - Thanks for all that you do!"
9:12 - Now, that might sound weird, but at the end
of the day, we're all just regular people.
9:17 - In fact, in 2017 when I started sending these
kinds of emails, I reached out to Tim Soulo,
9:22 - CMO at Ahrefs, to just say that I respect what
he's doing as a marketer – no agenda whatsoever.
9:28 - To which he replied: "You've made my day!"
9:30 - Fast forward one year, and
I ended up working at Ahrefs.
9:34 - Relationships in digital marketing are important.
9:36 - In social media, these are people
who can help amplify your work.
9:39 - On YouTube, these are potential collaborators.
9:42 - And in SEO, they're a critical part to link building.
9:46 - Now, as you continue to build your own
sites, work at agencies or other companies,
9:50 - and network with like-minded people, you're going
to come to a crossroad where you need to decide
9:57 - what's next.
9:58 - And I see three ways this can work –
none of which I think are wrong or right.
10:02 - So option 1, you can continue to
stay a generalist in your focus area.
10:06 - This means that you'll continue to build your
knowledge and experience in most areas of
10:11 - your specific field in digital marketing.
10:14 - The pros with this is that generalists often
become managers and leaders within companies
10:19 - because they get more or less
every part of what's being done.
10:23 - The con is that you never really become an
expert in anything, which obviously has its
10:29 - own set of limitations.
10:31 - Option 2, is to niche down further
in your focus area.
10:34 - So as you gain more knowledge and experience
in your focus area, you're going to realize that
10:39 - there's too much information to
become a true expert in your field.
10:44 - And for that reason, you may want to consider
niching down further because each digital
10:50 - marketing strategy breaks down quite a lot.
10:53 - For example, if you've chosen to focus on
social media, you may decide to focus strictly
10:57 - on Facebook marketing.
10:59 - Or perhaps you want to go more niche and choose
Facebook group marketing for software companies.
11:05 - Now, the pro of niching down is that it's
much easier to become recognized as
11:09 - a niche authority because there's less competition.
11:12 - And if you're viewed as "that" authority,
your reputation will likely be lasting and
11:17 - you can typically demand higher wages.
11:20 - The con is that there's usually less demand.
11:23 - And option 3 is to expand into
other areas of digital marketing.
11:27 - And this is kind of the route that I've gone.
11:29 - The way I recommend doing this is to expand
into areas where your skills are complementary
11:34 - and transferable.
11:35 - For example, starting from SEO and expanding
to content marketing is complementary and
11:41 - the skills from SEO are totally transferable.
11:44 - And even something like going from SEO to
search ads would also be complementary
11:49 - and some of those skills are transferable too.
11:51 - Now, being 14 years into my digital marketing
career, I can confidently tell you that I'm still
11:57 - learning all the time.
11:59 - And that's largely because I'm practicing a
lot of the things that I just shared with you.
12:03 - I work with a ton of smart people at Ahrefs in
various departments who I love learning from.
12:08 - I've had the opportunity to meet really smart
people at conferences, through social media,
12:13 - and even from random cold emails.
12:15 - And I go through seasons of intentional
learning, followed by intentional doing.
12:20 - Now, while I've screwed up in many ways,
I don't look at anything as a waste of time
12:25 - because it helped me to get
to where I am today.
12:27 - I'm definitely not the smartest, richest, most
recognized, or most successful digital marketer
12:33 - in the world.
12:34 - But this is a long journey that I've embraced
along the way and I hope it's one that you'll
12:39 - enjoy or are currently enjoying too.
12:41 - Now, if you want to start your digital marketing
career in SEO like I did, then I highly recommend
12:46 - watching our SEO course for beginners which
will teach you how to get free organic traffic
12:50 - to your site from start to finish.
12:53 - I'll see you there.
