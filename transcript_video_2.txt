0:05 - the most important things you need to
0:06 - know about digital marketing right now
0:08 - you see digital marketing has been made
0:10 - to seem way more complicated than it
0:12 - actually is that's a shame really
0:14 - because it's actually pretty
0:15 - straightforward that said if you do want
0:17 - to get the best results possible from
0:19 - your digital marketing you're going to
0:21 - need to know and understand the
0:23 - strategies that i'm going to be sharing
0:24 - with you in this episode so my promise
0:26 - to you is this if you watch this entire
0:28 - video you will be a better digital
0:30 - marketer at the end so let's get to it
0:35 - [Music]
0:37 - so the very first thing that i need to
0:38 - share with you are the differences
0:40 - between digital marketing and
0:42 - traditional marketing brace yourself for
0:44 - this one because it's pretty profound
0:45 - actually it's not profound at all and
0:47 - that's what makes it so interesting you
0:49 - see digital marketing is really just
0:51 - marketing done through the use of
0:53 - digital channels
0:54 - that's it so when we're talking about
0:56 - digital marketing while we're talking
0:58 - about marketing through the use of
0:59 - channels like seo or search engine
1:02 - optimization social media pay-per-click
1:05 - ads or online facebook ads instagram ads
1:07 - or anything like that not to mention
1:09 - email marketing or website optimization
1:11 - or anything that really takes place
1:14 - online or through the use of digital
1:15 - media you can contrast this with
1:18 - traditional marketing using traditional
1:20 - media things like tv or the radio or
1:23 - newspapers or magazines or billboards
1:25 - basically anything not digital now
1:27 - here's the deal traditional marketing
1:30 - and traditional advertising and
1:31 - everything that goes into it well it
1:33 - still works but there are some
1:34 - significant advantages to using digital
1:37 - marketing and all the digital channels
1:39 - that we now have available first of all
1:41 - digital marketing tends to give you a
1:42 - much larger audience size really you can
1:45 - reach anybody that's online and there's
1:47 - billions and billions of people online
1:49 - next is audience targeting because not
1:51 - only are you able to reach these
1:52 - billions of people well you don't want
1:54 - to reach all of them because all of them
1:56 - are not going to be the perfect fit for
1:57 - your business rather you can be laser
1:59 - focused and selective on only the most
2:02 - ideal and perfect people that you want
2:04 - to target digital marketing also tends
2:06 - to be significantly more cost effective
2:08 - than running say an ad in the new york
2:10 - times or heaven forbid a super bowl
2:12 - commercial again these are designed to
2:14 - appeal to mass markets and to try to
2:16 - reach everyone probably not your goal
2:19 - rather what you want to do is be laser
2:21 - focused and selective with your
2:22 - marketing and reach again only those
2:24 - people most likely to buy digital
2:25 - marketing also allows you to get
2:27 - immediate feedback and this is probably
2:28 - one of my favorite benefits of the
2:30 - channels after all if you think about
2:32 - running say a magazine ad where you've
2:34 - got to think of the copy and the
2:36 - creative and what you're going to say
2:37 - and then you've got to get it all
2:38 - written up and sent to the magazine it's
2:40 - got to get published and then
2:42 - distributed well you could be looking at
2:44 - weeks at best months and maybe many many
2:47 - months before you ever figure out if
2:49 - this worked or not digital marketing on
2:51 - the other hand well in theory you can
2:53 - write an ad and have it online in a
2:55 - matter of minutes immediate feedback
2:57 - immediate correction immediate results
2:59 - plus digital marketing tends to be a
3:01 - whole lot easier to measure and to track
3:03 - because everything's digital which means
3:05 - we've got a digital trail allowing us to
3:08 - measure costs and results and everything
3:11 - in real time so we can make adjustments
3:13 - and tweaks and optimizations on the fly
3:15 - again contrast that with waiting three
3:18 - months for your magazine to come out and
3:19 - figure out if things worked or not and
3:21 - you can't measure clicks on a magazine
3:22 - so the best you can hope to do is well
3:24 - really either have them fill out some
3:26 - kind of a form on the magazine or visit
3:28 - a digital channel which ties us back
3:30 - into digital marketing anyway there's
3:32 - obviously some serious advantages here
3:34 - to choosing digital channels going with
3:36 - digital marketing but again that's not
3:38 - to say that traditional marketing
3:39 - doesn't still work it does the point
3:41 - here is to take a look at either
3:43 - traditional or digital marketing and
3:45 - then sort of take a few steps back to
3:48 - the strategies and the fundamentals and
3:50 - the principles the consumer psychology
3:52 - the buyer behavior why people do the
3:54 - things they do and then focus on
3:56 - mastering and learning that then you can
3:58 - apply that to digital channels or
4:00 - traditional channels or any other
4:02 - channels that come out in the future all
4:03 - right the next thing that'll really help
4:05 - you become a better digital marketer is
4:07 - to understand the differences between
4:09 - strategy and tactics and when to use
4:11 - them strategy is all the big picture
4:13 - stuff and this is really where you want
4:15 - to focus your efforts first and foremost
4:17 - because this is the foundation that all
4:19 - of your future marketing efforts and
4:21 - tactics and tools and software and
4:22 - things like that are going to be built
4:24 - on get this part wrong and nothing else
4:26 - matters because nothing else will work
4:28 - now there are a ton of different
4:30 - strategies and approaches and ways to
4:32 - look at your digital marketing but
4:34 - pretty much no matter how you look at it
4:36 - it always comes back to four basic and
4:39 - really solid principles that have stood
4:41 - the test of time and are going to be
4:42 - just as relevant today as they are a
4:44 - hundred years from now i call these
4:45 - things the core four and they make up
4:47 - the center of my hub and spoke model of
4:49 - marketing the core four are made up of
4:52 - model market message and media so let's
4:54 - unpack those now the model is
4:56 - essentially your business your offer
4:58 - your package your servicing the pricing
5:00 - that goes with it how you deliver
5:02 - whatever it is that you deliver to the
5:04 - market it's important here to design
5:06 - your model design your business around
5:08 - what is the most enjoyable and
5:10 - profitable and in demand by the market
5:12 - because the worst thing you can do is
5:14 - build a business that you absolutely
5:16 - hate next is the market these are the
5:18 - people that you're going to serve and
5:20 - you don't want to say everyone or anyone
5:22 - with money you want to be focused
5:24 - laser focused on exactly who is going to
5:26 - get the best results from your product
5:28 - or service and also the market that
5:30 - you're going to most enjoy serving in
5:32 - marketing we call this an ideal customer
5:34 - avatar or an ideal client avatar and
5:36 - it's made up of demographic details like
5:38 - age gender income occupation geographic
5:41 - details like what city or state or
5:43 - province or country they live in and
5:45 - psychographic details like what are
5:46 - their values their attitudes and their
5:49 - lifestyles next is your message and
5:51 - here's where you're going to clarify and
5:53 - connect with your ideal target market by
5:56 - speaking directly to them about their
5:58 - pains and their problems and their
5:59 - frustrations and how your business is
6:01 - uniquely positioned to help solve that
6:03 - for them telling stories about previous
6:06 - customers and previous client results is
6:08 - an incredibly effective way to do this
6:09 - as are getting testimonials directly
6:11 - from them and running case studies
6:13 - proving that you know what you're
6:14 - talking about and have done what you say
6:16 - you're going to do i think that made
6:18 - sense the point here is that to craft
6:20 - truly effective messages well you've got
6:22 - to understand who your market is and
6:24 - what really makes them up and what makes
6:26 - them do the things they do so a little
6:28 - bit of market research and having a few
6:30 - chats with your customers never hurts
6:31 - and the fourth part of the core four and
6:34 - again the center of that hub and spoke
6:35 - model of marketing is all about media
6:38 - and this is where you're going to go
6:39 - where you're going to do your marketing
6:42 - which digital channels you're gonna
6:43 - choose most businesses do this
6:45 - completely backwards they start with the
6:47 - media by hearing a great thing about
6:49 - facebook ads or youtube marketing maybe
6:51 - starting a podcast and then they just
6:53 - rush in there forgetting all about the
6:55 - message and the market and the model so
6:58 - unsurprisingly well they're building
6:59 - their business and they're building
7:01 - their marketing on a pretty sketchy
7:02 - foundation this is why if you go through
7:04 - the steps in the right order starting
7:06 - with the model moving on to the market
7:08 - identifying the message by the time you
7:09 - get to media the choices should be
7:12 - evidently clear like crystal clear you
7:14 - should know exactly where your ideal
7:16 - target market is present and active
7:18 - online and this is going to enable you
7:20 - to go there and ignore everything else
7:22 - the reality is you don't need to do
7:24 - everything you don't need to be
7:25 - everywhere you just need to be the
7:27 - places where your ideal target market
7:29 - are present and active this is going to
7:30 - save you a ton of time and money and
7:33 - headache and wasted energy by spreading
7:35 - yourself too thin on channels that
7:36 - simply aren't going to deliver results
7:38 - all right so that was the strategy the
7:40 - core 4 the high level stuff that goes
7:43 - into making the right decisions tactics
7:45 - on the other hand are how you're going
7:47 - to execute everything i've just talked
7:49 - about the tactics are the details and
7:51 - the actionable steps or executable
7:54 - things that you're actually going to go
7:56 - and put into practice so the strategy
7:58 - being the business model you're using
8:00 - the market that you're going to go after
8:01 - the messages you're going to use and the
8:03 - media choices that you're going to
8:05 - deploy your marketing on and then the
8:06 - tactics being things like what frequency
8:09 - are you going to post and what kind of
8:11 - content are you gonna post and what
8:14 - schedule or level of consistency or how
8:17 - many memes are you gonna throw in a
8:18 - tactical question would be what's the
8:20 - best time to post on social media a
8:23 - strategic question would be which social
8:25 - media platform should we be on that's
8:27 - the difference all right the next thing
8:29 - that you need to know about digital
8:31 - marketing is the difference between
8:32 - organic and paid so let's start with
8:34 - organic organic content and organic
8:37 - digital marketing is essentially
8:38 - anything that you create
8:40 - for free so anytime that you make a post
8:42 - on facebook or an instagram story or a
8:46 - youtube video or anything like that and
8:48 - you're not paying money to have it
8:50 - promoted you're creating organic content
8:52 - now this doesn't mean that it's free
8:54 - content because odds are good you put
8:56 - time and energy and probably a decent
8:58 - amount of money behind the content that
9:00 - you're creating but by not paying to
9:03 - promote it it's still classified as
9:05 - organic content so if organic marketing
9:07 - is putting out content and not paying to
9:09 - have it promoted well then paid
9:11 - marketing is the opposite of that
9:13 - putting out content and then paying the
9:15 - networks to promote it and distribute it
9:17 - to even more people basically with paid
9:19 - media or paid marketing paid ads you're
9:22 - running advertising to whatever message
9:24 - or whatever content that you're putting
9:25 - out there now the big players in the
9:27 - space right now are obviously the
9:29 - kingpins like facebook ads instagram ads
9:32 - and youtube ads linkedin ads and google
9:35 - ads essentially the major networks with
9:37 - ads added to the back of their name
9:39 - organic content shows up in the news
9:41 - feeds of people that follow you whereas
9:43 - with paid marketing and paid media it
9:45 - shows up in the news feeds and on the
9:47 - phones and on the devices of the people
9:49 - that you choose through targeting now of
9:51 - course like all marketing strategies
9:53 - there's pros and cons to both organic is
9:56 - free essentially in nature but it's
9:58 - going to be a little more limited in
9:59 - reach because the way the algorithms
10:01 - work is they kind of favor paid media
10:03 - because they like to make money paid
10:04 - media on the other hand has the obvious
10:06 - downside of costing money
10:08 - bright side it allows you to reach a ton
10:10 - of people very quickly so essentially
10:12 - the choice between organic and paid
10:14 - comes down to time versus money but also
10:16 - the rate at which you want to experience
10:18 - results all right now let's talk about
10:20 - one of my favorite topics in all of
10:22 - marketing direct response versus brand
10:24 - awareness direct response marketing is
10:26 - unsurprisingly direct in its goal to get
10:29 - a response man marketing sure isn't very
10:31 - creative sometimes basically when you do
10:33 - direct response marketing you're
10:35 - creating an ad or you're creating a
10:37 - piece of content and you're focused on
10:39 - getting an immediate and tangible return
10:42 - something like a lead or a sale or a
10:45 - phone call or a visit or a sign up or
10:48 - something like that direct response
10:49 - marketing would be run a facebook ad
10:51 - expect to generate a lead send out an
10:53 - email measure the number of conversions
10:55 - promote a video track how many people
10:57 - signed up for a free trial all of these
10:59 - are direct response because you're
11:01 - expecting something ideally immediately
11:03 - and you're going to be able to track and
11:04 - measure it so you can do more of what
11:05 - works and less of what doesn't now
11:07 - contrast all of that with brand
11:09 - awareness marketing which is essentially
11:10 - more focused on longer term and building
11:13 - trust and authority and your brand name
11:15 - in the market with direct response we're
11:17 - measuring things like leads and sales
11:19 - and conversions with brand awareness
11:21 - we're measuring things like trust and
11:24 - authority and possibly mentions but a
11:27 - lot harder to quantify and to measure
11:30 - because they're a lot more intangible
11:32 - the reality is long term to build a
11:34 - scalable and sustainable and profitable
11:36 - business well you do need a pretty
11:38 - decent mix of both direct response
11:40 - marketing and brand awareness marketing
11:43 - but you have to be wary of the cardinal
11:45 - sin of marketing you see one of the
11:47 - biggest mistakes in all of marketing is
11:49 - running brand awareness marketing
11:51 - campaigns and expecting direct response
11:53 - results this is a recipe for failure and
11:56 - one of the biggest reasons that many
11:57 - people claim their marketing just isn't
12:00 - working it's because they're using the
12:01 - wrong tool for the job like following a
12:04 - recipe to bake a cake and then getting
12:05 - really frustrated when it comes out like
12:07 - muffins or bread or anything that isn't
12:10 - cake this is why it's incredibly
12:11 - important that you use the right recipe
12:13 - your strategy for the job all right
12:15 - another incredibly important thing you
12:16 - need to know about digital marketing is
12:18 - the difference between search and
12:20 - discovery marketing when it comes to
12:22 - search versus discovery marketing the
12:24 - biggest and most important or keyword if
12:26 - you will is intent basically what's the
12:29 - intent or what is the reason that
12:32 - someone's using a specific platform when
12:34 - they log on in the morning or at noon or
12:37 - at night so let's start with search and
12:39 - here we're talking about platforms like
12:41 - google and youtube basically any other
12:44 - search engine when someone logs on to
12:45 - google for example well they have intent
12:48 - they're there to find an answer or a
12:50 - solution or a product they're there to
12:52 - do something or buy something or learn
12:55 - something or take some kind of action
12:56 - this is where you as a marketer want to
12:59 - show up in front of them and basically
13:01 - answer their question or give them the
13:03 - solution to whatever it is that they're
13:04 - looking for some strategies here are
13:06 - using seo or search engine optimization
13:09 - as well as google ads which is
13:10 - pay-per-click advertising discovery
13:12 - marketing on the other hand well this
13:14 - encompasses brands like facebook and
13:16 - instagram and youtube to a certain
13:18 - extent essentially a user on these
13:21 - platforms may have intent but they're
13:23 - probably more casually browsing after
13:25 - all nobody really shows up in the
13:26 - morning logs onto facebook or instagram
13:28 - with a credit card in hand looking to
13:30 - buy something this is why if you're
13:31 - doing search marketing well you can
13:33 - afford to be direct they're looking for
13:35 - something you have the answer so you can
13:37 - just give it to them with discovery
13:38 - marketing on the other hand you've got
13:39 - to be a little more creative and a
13:41 - little more entertaining you've got to
13:43 - get their attention and then keep it and
13:45 - allow them to become interested in what
13:47 - it is that you're selling or promoting
13:49 - now both search marketing and discovery
13:51 - marketing are incredibly important parts
13:53 - to building an overall successful
13:55 - sustainable business but just like with
13:58 - direct response marketing and brand
14:00 - awareness marketing you want to make
14:01 - sure that you're using the right tool
14:03 - for the right job at the right time in
14:05 - the right place alright next i've got
14:07 - something very important to share with
14:09 - you and it's something that rarely gets
14:10 - talked about when it comes to marketing
14:12 - advice and that is the difference
14:14 - between marketing products and marketing
14:16 - services here's the deal most of the
14:18 - marketing information out there whether
14:20 - we're talking about textbooks or courses
14:23 - or even trainings they revolve around
14:25 - the marketing of products a product
14:27 - being something tangible that you can
14:29 - hold that you can see that you can touch
14:32 - and that you can taste a service on the
14:34 - other hand is intangible you can't hold
14:36 - it can't touch it can't see it can't
14:39 - taste it plus with services you often
14:41 - need to pay in advance which requires a
14:43 - whole new level of trust this is why if
14:45 - you're marketing a service based
14:47 - business and you try to market it like a
14:49 - product based business well you're gonna
14:50 - be very disappointed now when it comes
14:52 - to marketing products you have the
14:54 - opportunity and the advantage of being
14:56 - able to explain and to show and to
14:58 - demonstrate how a product works what it
15:00 - looks like you want to show it in action
15:02 - show the features show the benefits that
15:04 - the features will deliver show the story
15:06 - behind it everything like that here's an
15:08 - example let's say that i'm trying to
15:10 - promote and sell this pen well the fact
15:12 - that this pen has a lid is a feature the
15:15 - fact that it will prevent me from
15:17 - getting ink all over myself that's a
15:19 - benefit but you can take it further and
15:21 - you probably should for example this pen
15:23 - lid also has a clip which means that i
15:25 - can attach it to my papers or my
15:28 - notebook or even my clothes if i'm
15:30 - trying to sport that nerdy look another
15:32 - feature of the pen lid itself is the
15:34 - fact that the lid has holes in the top
15:36 - maybe surprised to hear that the reason
15:38 - that pen lids have holes in the top is
15:39 - to prevent suffocation in case they
15:41 - accidentally or purposely get swallowed
15:44 - after all chewing on pen lids is an
15:46 - age-old albeit highly unsanitary
15:48 - practice sometimes you just get hungry
15:50 - services on the other hand well they
15:51 - don't have that advantage so the main
15:53 - thing when you're promoting and
15:54 - marketing services is you want to sell
15:57 - the end essentially the end state or the
15:59 - benefits or the outcome or the results
16:02 - that someone will experience after
16:04 - working with you in fact when it comes
16:06 - to marketing services i'd go so far as
16:08 - to say it's pretty much all about the
16:09 - end state and the benefits and the
16:11 - outcomes and the results someone will
16:13 - experience the key here is to highlight
16:14 - the current pain or dissatisfaction or
16:17 - discomfort of their current state and
16:19 - then of course paint the picture of how
16:21 - they'll be so much better after having
16:23 - worked with you all right the next thing
16:25 - you really need to be aware of if you
16:26 - want to become a true expert in digital
16:28 - marketing is to understand the
16:30 - differences between b2b and b2c
16:32 - marketing b2b stands for business to
16:34 - business and this is where your main
16:36 - customers your main clients aren't
16:38 - regular everyday people but rather other
16:40 - businesses b2c on the other hand means
16:43 - you're a business that sells to
16:44 - consumers regular everyday people and
16:47 - not businesses b2b business to business
16:49 - b2c business to consumer and just like
16:51 - everything i've shared with you so far
16:53 - there's some significant differences in
16:55 - the way that you want to market your
16:56 - business market your service market your
16:58 - product market whatever depending on
17:00 - whether you're selling to businesses or
17:02 - people and this is why the next thing
17:03 - you're going to want to do is check out
17:05 - the video i have linked up right here on
17:07 - b2b vs b2c marketing so make sure to
17:09 - check that out now and i'll see in the
