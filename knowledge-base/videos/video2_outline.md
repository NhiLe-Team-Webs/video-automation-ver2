### Recurring Cues

- `highlighted_background` remains the default text treatment throughout; maintain consistency unless context demands variation.
- Comparisons thrive on side-by-side overlays (for example, "Feature | Benefit", "Organic | Paid"); ensure columns stay balanced.
- Introduce new terminology with matching SFX and maintain momentum with responsive motion cues.
- Reserve zoom chains for genuine emphasis; interleave with fades or slides to give viewers recovery time.
