### Recurring Cues

- Lists expand rather than reset, so design overlays that append items sequentially.
- Credibility signals ("Forbes", "Inc", "Top 1%") deserve combined overlay plus b-roll emphasis.
- Failure stories lean on darker-toned visuals and restrained SFX; resolve with lighter shots as tone lifts.
- Relationship-building advice pairs well with collaborative or networking imagery.
