# Data Sources

| Source | Role in pipeline | Notable details |
| ------ | ---------------- | --------------- |
| `AI_Training_Plan.md` | Master plan for curating datasets, extracting features, training and evaluating models. | Written in Vietnamese; covers nine stages from data auditing to deployment and includes risk mitigation notes. |
| `transcript_video_1.txt` | Full transcript with timestamps for *How I Would Learn Digital Marketing (If I Could Start Over)*. | Highlights speaker journey, three-part learning framework, practice principles, and career path discussion. |
| `video1.json` | Annotated timeline aligned to `transcript_video_1.txt`. | 188 timestamp entries plus `video_metadata` with element glossaries, layering rules, editing patterns, and AI-specific notes. |
| `transcript_video_2.txt` | Transcript and timing for *Digital Marketing 101 (A Beginner's Guide to Marketing)*. | Explains foundational marketing concepts, channel definitions, and comparison frameworks (digital vs. traditional, B2B vs. B2C, products vs. services). |
| `video2.json` | Timeline annotations for `transcript_video_2.txt`. | Emphasis on text overlays with highlighted backgrounds, frequent zoom transitions, and context fields describing intent of each element. |
| Asset catalogs (`assets/*.json`) | Authoritative source for available b-roll, motion, and SFX assets. | Documented in detail inside [asset_catalogs.md](asset_catalogs.md); include tags, moods, and usage constraints used during inference. |

### Extraction Reminders

- Keep transcript timestamps in `M:SS` and convert to seconds during preprocessing.
- Preserve `context`, `style`, `animation`, and `sound` attributes; they contain supervision signals even when absent from transcripts.
- When augmenting data, cross-link transcript spans to timeline entries via timestamp proximity (+/- 1 second window works for both videos).
- Track narrative sections (e.g., `Part 1`, `B2B vs B2C`) to help the model learn context-aware element placement.
- Synchronise with asset catalogs so generated descriptions map to real `id`s and comply with motion spacing rules.
