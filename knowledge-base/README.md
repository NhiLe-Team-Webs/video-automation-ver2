# AI Planning Knowledge Base

Central repository of reference materials that support training, inference, and evaluation of the video plan-generation pipeline.

## Scope
- Consolidates rules, definitions, workflows, criteria, examples, and asset references derived from:
  - `AI_Training_Plan.md`
  - `transcript_video_1.txt` / `video1.json`
  - `transcript_video_2.txt` / `video2.json`
  - Asset catalogs under `assets/`
- Goal: guide the model to place highlights, b-roll, sound effects, overlays, and motion cues with high accuracy and narrative relevance.

## Directory Map
- `data_sources.md` - provenance and key takeaways from transcripts, timelines, and catalogs.
- `training_pipeline.md` - end-to-end preparation and modelling process.
- `element_definitions.md` - glossary for element types, layers, and default behaviours.
- `element_schema.json` - machine-readable schema describing required fields, enumerations, and validation constraints.
- `planning_guidelines.md` - actionable rules for proposing timeline elements with cross-references.
- `quality_criteria.md` - success metrics and acceptance checkpoints.
- `glossary.md` - domain terminology used across the knowledge base.
- `asset_catalogs.md` - how to incorporate `broll`, `sfx`, `motion`, and context catalogs into modelling.
- `examples/` - qualitative (`patterns.md`) and structured (`patterns.json`) editing exemplars.
- `videos/` - narrative blueprints for each reference video (summary, audience, themes, cue suggestions).
- `CHANGELOG.md` - tracked updates to maintain version history.

## Usage Guidance
1. Review `data_sources.md` to understand raw inputs and supporting catalogs.
2. Align feature engineering and targets using `training_pipeline.md`, `element_definitions.md`, and `element_schema.json`.
3. During plan generation, enforce `planning_guidelines.md` and validate against `quality_criteria.md`.
4. Leverage `asset_catalogs.md` alongside the JSON catalogs to ensure selected assets exist and honour motion rules.
5. Consult `videos/` and `examples/` for grounded samples (positive and negative) before crafting prompts, labels, or rule-based validators.
6. Log any documentation changes in `CHANGELOG.md` so training runs can reference the correct knowledge base version.
