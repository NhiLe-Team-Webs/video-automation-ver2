Overlays should be concise, and visuals should directly support the message without distraction.\n**Brand Consistency**: Adhere to established brand guidelines for styles, colors, and animations.\n**Layer Management**: Avoid visual clutter by respecting the layer stack hierarchy and ensuring elements do not overlap unnecessarily.\n**Sound Reinforcement**: Use sound effects judiciously to enhance emphasis and transitions, not to overwhelm the viewer."

      "2. Preprocess & Align: Merge transcript text with timeline entries by timestamp, producing windows (5-10 seconds) that give sufficient context.\nNormalize timestamps to seconds for easier maths and modelling.\nSegment transcripts into sentences or clauses; tokenise and build embeddings (Sentence-BERT or equivalent).\nEncode video elements: one-hot for categorical fields, embeddings for text-heavy attributes (`description`, `content`); ensure categorical vocab matches [element_schema.json](element_schema.json).",
      "Usage Guidelines: **Match by Context Tags** - ensure each generated element includes `context` (see `element_schema.json`). Use it to query `context_rules.json` and retrieve permitted `broll` or `sfx` tags.\n**Validate Asset Availability** - before finalising a plan, confirm `description` or `sound` values map to existing `id`s in the relevant catalog; log fallback suggestions when no exact match is found.\n**Respect Motion Constraints** - defer to `motion_rules.json` for allowable sequences (for example, minimum 0.5 s spacing between identical zooms).\n**Enrich Training Examples** - augment training data with catalog metadata (for example, embed `mood` vectors) so the model learns to pick assets aligned with emotional tone.\n**Keep Catalogs Synced** - update version numbers and regeneration timestamps when assets change; propagate updates to downstream caches.",
      "Extraction Reminders: Keep transcript timestamps in `M:SS` and convert to seconds during preprocessing.\nPreserve `context`, `style`, `animation`, and `sound` attributes; they contain supervision signals even when absent from transcripts.\nWhen augmenting data, cross-link transcript spans to timeline entries via timestamp proximity (+/- 1 second window works for both videos).\nTrack narrative sections (e.g., `Part 1`, `B2B vs B2C`) to help the model learn context-aware element placement.\nSynchronise with asset catalogs so generated descriptions map to real `id`s and comply with motion spacing rules."

It outlines the video's core elements, including its title, summary, target audience, tone, pacing, and primary themes. This blueprint serves as a guide for AI model training and video plan generation, ensuring that the output aligns with the original video's intent and structure.\n**Title:** *How I Would Learn Digital Marketing (If I Could Start Over)*\n**Summary:** Speaker recounts a 14-year marketing journey, distilling mistakes, learning frameworks, and practice principles into a repeatable roadmap.\n**Target audience:** Early-career marketers who need a structured plan to specialise and grow credibility.\n**Tone and pacing:** Authoritative yet conversational; alternates between reflective storytelling and energetic calls to action.\n**Primary themes:** Focus, structured learning, disciplined practice, career path selection, credibility building.\nSection\nTimestamp\nNarrative focus\nElement opportunities\nEmotional tone\nIntroduction\n0:00-0:35\nEstablishes career credibility and achievements.\n`speaker_intro`, business montage b-roll, magazine overlays, `achievement_highlight` for \"Top 1%\".\nConfident, aspirational\nPart 1: Choose One Area\n0:35-2:02\nShares early missteps and lesson on focus.\nOverlay \"Choose One Area\", b-roll metaphors for distractions, `money_loss` SFX on wasted spend moments.\nCautionary, reflective\nPart 2: Commit to Learning\n2:02-4:24\nIntroduces three-stage learning framework.\nProgressive list overlays, `flow_chart` or `typing_effect` animations, instrument/cooking b-roll metaphors.\nInstructive, structured\nPart 3: Commit to Practicing\n4:24-10:02\nPractical execution guide: cut content, prioritise, agency work, avoid shortcuts, network.\nExpanding checklist overlays, `typing` SFX, agency/workspace b-roll, `zoom_in` on cautionary story beats.\nMotivational, urgent\nCareer Paths\n10:02-11:51\nPresents options: stay generalist, niche down, expand skills.\nComparison table overlay, workplace b-roll varieties, gentle transition effects between options.\nStrategic, optimistic\nConclusion and CTA\n11:51-12:53\nSummarises journey, invites viewers to SEO course.\nClosing overlay \"Start Your SEO Journey\", upbeat b-roll, `success` or `achievement` SFX.\nEncouraging, forward-looking",
      "Introduction & Hook: **Pattern**: Speaker intro with a bold, engaging question.\n**Elements**: `speaker_intro` (main layer), `text_overlay` (overlay layer) with `bold_emphasis` style.\n**Rationale**: Immediately captures viewer attention and sets the stage for the video's core topic.",
      "Extraction Reminders: Keep transcript timestamps in `M:SS` and convert to seconds during preprocessing.\nPreserve `context`, `style`, `animation`, and `sound` attributes; they contain supervision signals even when absent from transcripts.\nWhen augmenting data, cross-link transcript spans to timeline entries via timestamp proximity (+/- 1 second window works for both videos).\nTrack narrative sections (e.g., `Part 1`, `B2B vs B2C`) to help the model learn context-aware element placement.\nSynchronise with asset catalogs so generated descriptions map to real `id`s and comply with motion spacing rules."

Overlays should be concise, and visuals should directly support the message without distraction.\n**Brand Consistency**: Adhere to established brand guidelines for styles, colors, and animations.\n**Layer Management**: Avoid visual clutter by respecting the layer stack hierarchy and ensuring elements do not overlap unnecessarily.\n**Sound Reinforcement**: Use sound effects judiciously to enhance emphasis and transitions, not to overwhelm the viewer.",

Use it to query `context_rules.json` and retrieve permitted `broll` or `sfx` tags.\n**Validate Asset Availability** - before finalising a plan, confirm `description` or `sound` values map to existing `id`s in the relevant catalog; log fallback suggestions when no exact match is found.\n**Respect Motion Constraints** - defer to `motion_rules.json` for allowable sequences (for example, minimum 0.5 s spacing between identical zooms).\n**Enrich Training Examples** - augment training data with catalog metadata (for example, embed `mood` vectors) so the model learns to pick assets aligned with emotional tone.\n**Keep Catalogs Synced** - update version numbers and regeneration timestamps when assets change; propagate updates to downstream caches."
