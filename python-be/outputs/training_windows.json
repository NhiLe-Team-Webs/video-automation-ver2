      "Video 1 Narrative Blueprint: This document provides a detailed narrative blueprint for \"Video 1: How I Would Learn Digital Marketing (If I Could Start Over)\". It outlines the video's core elements, including its title, summary, target audience, tone, pacing, and primary themes. This blueprint serves as a guide for AI model training and video plan generation, ensuring that the output aligns with the original video's intent and structure.\n**Title:** *How I Would Learn Digital Marketing (If I Could Start Over)*\n**Summary:** Speaker recounts a 14-year marketing journey, distilling mistakes, learning frameworks, and practice principles into a repeatable roadmap.\n**Target audience:** Early-career marketers who need a structured plan to specialise and grow credibility.\n**Tone and pacing:** Authoritative yet conversational; alternates between reflective storytelling and energetic calls to action.\n**Primary themes:** Focus, structured learning, disciplined practice, career path selection, credibility building.\nSection\nTimestamp\nNarrative focus\nElement opportunities\nEmotional tone\nIntroduction\n0:00-0:35\nEstablishes career credibility and achievements.\n`speaker_intro`, business montage b-roll, magazine overlays, `achievement_highlight` for \"Top 1%\".\nConfident, aspirational\nPart 1: Choose One Area\n0:35-2:02\nShares early missteps and lesson on focus.\nOverlay \"Choose One Area\", b-roll metaphors for distractions, `money_loss` SFX on wasted spend moments.\nCautionary, reflective\nPart 2: Commit to Learning\n2:02-4:24\nIntroduces three-stage learning framework.\nProgressive list overlays, `flow_chart` or `typing_effect` animations, instrument/cooking b-roll metaphors.\nInstructive, structured\nPart 3: Commit to Practicing\n4:24-10:02\nPractical execution guide: cut content, prioritise, agency work, avoid shortcuts, network.\nExpanding checklist overlays, `typing` SFX, agency/workspace b-roll, `zoom_in` on cautionary story beats.\nMotivational, urgent\nCareer Paths\n10:02-11:51\nPresents options: stay generalist, niche down, expand skills.\nComparison table overlay, workplace b-roll varieties, gentle transition effects between options.\nStrategic, optimistic\nConclusion and CTA\n11:51-12:53\nSummarises journey, invites viewers to SEO course.\nClosing overlay \"Start Your SEO Journey\", upbeat b-roll, `success` or `achievement` SFX.\nEncouraging, forward-looking",
      "Synchronisation Notes: Multiple elements can share the same timestamp; treat them as simultaneous but respect layer ordering.\nTransitions (`effect`) should begin before or exactly with the visual/text they introduce.\nUse `style` values to keep branding consistent (default: `highlighted_background` for critical callouts).\nPopulate `context` to support catalog lookups (see [asset_catalogs.md](asset_catalogs.md)).\nRecord `confidence` when available to support downstream thresholding (optional field in `element_schema.json`)."

Use it to query `context_rules.json` and retrieve permitted `broll` or `sfx` tags.\n**Validate Asset Availability** - before finalising a plan, confirm `description` or `sound` values map to existing `id`s in the relevant catalog; log fallback suggestions when no exact match is found.\n**Respect Motion Constraints** - defer to `motion_rules.json` for allowable sequences (for example, minimum 0.5 s spacing between identical zooms).\n**Enrich Training Examples** - augment training data with catalog metadata (for example, embed `mood` vectors) so the model learns to pick assets aligned with emotional tone.\n**Keep Catalogs Synced** - update version numbers and regeneration timestamps when assets change; propagate updates to downstream caches.",
      "Synchronisation Notes: Multiple elements can share the same timestamp; treat them as simultaneous but respect layer ordering.\nTransitions (`effect`) should begin before or exactly with the visual/text they introduce.\nUse `style` values to keep branding consistent (default: `highlighted_background` for critical callouts).\nPopulate `context` to support catalog lookups (see [asset_catalogs.md](asset_catalogs.md)).\nRecord `confidence` when available to support downstream thresholding (optional field in `element_schema.json`).",

      "Usage Guidance: Review `data_sources.md` to understand raw inputs and supporting catalogs.\nAlign feature engineering and targets using `training_pipeline.md`, `element_definitions.md`, and `element_schema.json`.\nDuring plan generation, enforce `planning_guidelines.md` and validate against `quality_criteria.md`.\nLeverage `asset_catalogs.md` alongside the JSON catalogs to ensure selected assets exist and honour motion rules.\nConsult `videos/` and `examples/` for grounded samples (positive and negative) before crafting prompts, labels, or rule-based validators.\nLog any documentation changes in `CHANGELOG.md` so training runs can reference the correct knowledge base version."
