      "Glossary: Short definitions grounded in the reference transcripts and training documentation.\n**Digital marketing** - marketing activities executed through digital channels (SEO, social media, PPC, email, websites). *Related:* Traditional marketing.\n**Traditional marketing** - offline channels such as print, radio, direct mail; contrasted with digital to highlight reach and measurability differences. *See also:* [planning_guidelines.md](planning_guidelines.md#narrative-alignment).\n**SEO (Search Engine Optimization)** - practice of improving organic visibility; central focus of the speaker's career pivot in Video 1. *Related:* Search marketing.\n**B-roll** - supplemental footage used to visualise or emphasise narration. *See also:* [asset_catalogs.md](asset_catalogs.md#catalog-overview).\n**Callout / Highlight** - on-screen emphasis for key phrases, statistics, or warnings, typically rendered as `text_overlay`.\n**Framework** - structured list or set of stages (for example, three-part learning model, four practice principles); often represented with progressive overlays.\n**Stage 1 / 2 / 3 (Learning)** - understand fundamentals -> connect fundamentals -> practise execution (Video 1).\n**Product marketing** - showcasing features and tangible benefits of a physical good.\n**Service marketing** - selling the outcome or end state (experience, trust, transformation) rather than the service mechanics.\n**B2B (Business to Business)** - companies selling to other businesses; longer cycles, committee decisions.\n**B2C (Business to Consumer)** - companies selling directly to consumers; faster decisions, emotion-driven.\n**Feature vs Benefit** - feature describes what something is; benefit explains the value it delivers (Video 2 pen example).\n**Trust signals** - elements that reinforce credibility (awards, experience, social proof).\n**Motion cue** - visual effect (zoom, slide) signalling a narrative shift or emphasis. *See also:* Motion rules in `motion_rules.json`.\n**Embedding** - numeric vector representing semantic meaning of text or assets, used for similarity search and modelling (for example, Sentence-BERT). *Related:* Feature engineering.\n**Word2Vec / GloVe / Sentence-BERT** - families of embedding models; Sentence-BERT produces sentence-level vectors well suited for transcript windows.\n**One-hot encoding** - representation where each category maps to a unique vector with a single 1 and the rest 0; used for element types and styles.\n**Regression head** - model component predicting continuous values (for example, `timestamp`, `duration`). *See:* `training_pipeline.md`.\n**Multi-label classification** - predicting multiple boolean outcomes simultaneously (for example, presence of several element families in a window).\n**MAE (Mean Absolute Error)** - evaluation metric for regression measuring average absolute difference between predicted and true values.\n**F1 score** - harmonic mean of precision and recall; used to assess classification performance.\n**BLEU / ROUGE** - text generation metrics comparing model output to reference wording; apply to overlay copy evaluation.\n**Early stopping** - training technique that halts optimisation when validation performance stops improving to avoid overfitting.\n**Curriculum learning** - training strategy that teaches simpler tasks before harder ones (for example, predict type before content).\n**Confidence score** - probability estimate output by the model indicating reliability of a prediction; captured in `element_schema.json`.\n**Layer stack** - render order from `main` -> `video` -> `overlay` -> `audio` -> `transition`; detailed in [element_definitions.md](element_definitions.md#layer-stack).\n**Context tag** - short descriptive string indicating narrative intent (for example, \"mistake warning\"); used to query asset catalogs and maintain coherence.",
      "6. Evaluation: Quantitative: accuracy/F1 for type classification, MAE for timestamps, BLEU/ROUGE for generated text.\nQualitative: human review against `quality_criteria.md` with focus on narrative fit and layer conflicts.\nStress tests: long speaking segments without elements, rapid-fire sections with many overlays, sections requiring metaphors.",
      "8. Maintenance Cadence: Quarterly data refresh to incorporate new annotated videos.\nMonthly error analysis session targeting repeated failure modes (mis-timed SFX, incorrect layer stacking).\nCapture feedback from editors to expand context tags and example catalogues."
