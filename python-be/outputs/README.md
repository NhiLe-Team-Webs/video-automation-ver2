# Output Files

This directory stores the output files generated by the video automation pipeline. These files represent intermediate or final results of the processing steps.

## Files:

- [`plan_enriched.json`](python-be/outputs/plan_enriched.json): The final, enriched video edit plan. This JSON file contains detailed instructions for video segments, highlights, transitions, B-roll assignments, and motion cues, ready for consumption by the Remotion frontend or MoviePy editor.

- [`scene_map.json`](python-be/outputs/scene_map.json): A structured scene map generated from the SRT transcript. It includes timing, topical tags, highlight heuristics, CTA flags, and motion cue candidates for each segment of the video.
