# Knowledge Cache Artifacts

This directory (`python-be/outputs/knowledge/`) contains generated files that serve as cached artifacts of the processed knowledge base. These files are crucial for the efficient operation of the AI video automation pipeline, providing pre-processed and vectorized data for various runtime components.

Generated files produced by `python data_processing/sync_knowledge_base.py`.

| File | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| `structured.json` | A serialized list of all parsed Markdown and JSON documents from the `knowledge-base/` directory. This includes their metadata, extracted sections, and headings, structured according to the `KnowledgeDocument` model. |
| `embeddings.json` | Stores the vector embeddings for individual text sections of the Markdown documents. These embeddings are used for semantic search, retrieval-augmented generation, and efficient lookup of relevant guidelines. |
| `schema_cache.json` | Contains SHA-256 hashes of all validated JSON schema files. This cache is used to quickly detect changes in schema definitions, triggering re-ingestion or validation processes as needed. |
| `.gitkeep` | A placeholder file to ensure that this directory remains under version control, even when it is otherwise empty. |

> ⚠️ **Important Note:** These files are automatically regenerated by the `sync_knowledge_base.py` script. **DO NOT edit them manually.** Any manual changes will be overwritten during the next synchronization. If a clean rebuild is required, delete the entire `python-be/outputs/knowledge/` folder and then rerun the synchronization command.
