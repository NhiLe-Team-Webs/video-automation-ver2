# Purpose of .gitkeep

The `.gitkeep` file in the `python-be/outputs/knowledge/` directory is a placeholder file. Its sole purpose is to ensure that the `knowledge` directory, which might otherwise be empty, is tracked by Git.

Git does not track empty directories. However, this directory is intended to store generated output files (like `embeddings.json`, `structured.json`, `schema_cache.json`) that are crucial for the AI pipeline. By including `.gitkeep`, we ensure that the directory structure is preserved in the repository, even when these output files are not present (e.g., after a fresh clone or a clean operation).

This file itself contains no functional content and should remain empty.
